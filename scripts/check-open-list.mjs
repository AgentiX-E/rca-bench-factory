/**
 * The Open list must be readable by something other than the person who wrote it.
 *
 * ## What was measured
 *
 * `docs/progress.md` ends with an `### Open` list of residuals. Three separate
 * rounds have now found an entry in it that had stopped meaning anything:
 *
 * | entry | state when it was read |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `--stdin` has no automatic invoker | **closed eleven passes earlier** by finding 150, and nothing noticed |
 * | the `commits` count gate is still to be done | the document publishes **no `commits` count at all** (finding 159) |
 * | six scripts in run #174 were never read individually | the job that ran them no longer runs a suite; both cold aggregates pass on a cold tree (finding 159) |
 *
 * The first one was corrected by hand and its correction says what the problem is:
 * *"The line above stood for eleven passes after that, because nothing reads an
 * 'open' list."* Writing that sentence did not give the list a reader, and two more
 * stale entries accumulated behind it.
 *
 * ## What this guard can and cannot check
 *
 * It cannot check whether an entry is *still true* -- that needs the measurement the
 * entry is about, and a script cannot guess it. What it can check is that each entry
 * **says which it is**:
 *
 * - `closed` -- struck through, with the finding that closed it named (`~~...~~`
 *   plus `Closed by finding N`), so a reader knows the line is history and not work;
 * - `open` -- carries `[open: <reason>]`, and the reason has to be a sentence,
 *   because "still open" is not a reason and the entry below it is the evidence.
 *
 * That is the same trade finding 153 made for its exemption table: the check can
 * refuse a placeholder, and it cannot refuse a wrong-but-fluent sentence. Stated
 * here rather than left to look like more than it is.
 *
 * ## Subject
 *
 * The section is located by its **heading**, not by any line that mentions the word
 * "open" -- finding 155's bug, where the guard read the headline table because a row
 * in it cross-referenced the section.
 *
 * Every section with that heading is read, not the first one. That was finding 162:
 * this guard located its subject with `findIndex`, a pass appended a second `### Open`
 * section, and the new list had no reader -- the count it printed did not move and
 * nothing in the output said a second list existed. A document that gains a list must
 * gain a reader for it, and the only way to hold that is to read all of them.
 *
 * `--doc <path>` reads a different document, so the fixtures in
 * `packages/core/test/check-open-list.test.ts` can drive the script itself. Which
 * sections are read is not a predicate, so the copy-the-regexes route those tests use
 * for the two judges could not have answered this question.

/**
 * What a closed entry has to say, and why the old rule did not make it say that.
 *
 * The docstring above promises "struck through, **with the finding that closed it
 * named**". The regex was `/~~|Closed by finding \d+/`, which is satisfied by a
 * strikethrough alone -- so half the promise was unenforced, and eleven of the twenty
 * closed entries could not have satisfied it anyway: their citation wraps
 * (`**Closed by\nfinding 170.**`) and a pattern without `\s+` cannot see across the
 * break. A rule stated in prose and a rule enforced in code had drifted, which is the
 * defect this whole guard exists to catch in other people's lists.
 *
 * So the citation is required, and there are three authorities a closure can have:
 *
 * 1. a **finding** (`Closed by finding 170`), which is the common case;
 * 2. a **round** (`Closed by Pass 15`), because this log names rounds in two eras and
 *    a round is what closes most things;
 * 3. **explicitly not a finding** (`Closed without a finding: ...`, `Closed in this
 *    pass ...`), for closures whose authority is a measurement or a fix outside this
 *    tree -- and the sentence after it has to be long enough to be one.
 *
 * `[^.]{0,120}?` keeps the citation in the closure's own sentence: "Closed by the
 * workflow. Finding 170 later found something else." must not read as a citation.

 * is kept so the two sources of truth -- this scan and the document's own structure --
 * cannot drift apart on what "the section" means.
 *
 * The span is returned rather than only the lines because two spellings make nesting

 * sections whose entry counts overlap, and a guard that reported `2 section(s)` without
