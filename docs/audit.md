# Audit report

Findings from the scoring-path audit, with the measurement that established each
one. Every entry follows the same shape: the defect, the command that
demonstrated it, the observed number, the fix, and the guard that now fails
without the fix.

A finding is only listed here after being reproduced locally. A finding that only
appeared in a review, without a failing measurement, is not a finding.

## Scope

`packages/core/src/score/` — the official-metric scoring path. This is the code
that decides whether an export is scorable and what number it earns, so a defect
here silently mislabels a dataset rather than crashing.

## Summary

| # | Defect | Reproduced as | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The official-metric regression graded its own answer key | 4 of 4 corruptions silent | fixed |
| 2 | `rateOf` scored an empty denominator as a perfect match | `{"process":1,"chainNodeMatch":1}` → 100 | fixed |
| 3 | `checksumRate` divided by the anchor set, not the export | 1 anchor, 22 files → `score: 100` | fixed |
| 4 | `aggregateFor` had no branch for `openrca-2.0` | `final: 0` beside `accuracy: 0.75` | fixed |
| 5 | AIOps2025 `explainability` scored an empty corpus 1 | empty export → `final: 10` | fixed |
| 6 | A vacuous structure report earned half the score | empty export → `score: 15` | fixed |

Finding 6 was not in the original audit. It surfaced while building the guard for
finding 2 and is recorded because it is the same error one level up.

## 1 — The regression graded its own answer key

`runOfficialRegression` built its predictions with
`groundTruth.map(oraclePrediction)` instead of reading the submission the export
publishes. `readOfficialSubmission` was exported, tested, and never called on
this path.

The consequence is that the check compared the answer key against itself. A
`record.csv` that had been corrupted or deleted still reported `passed`. Four
injections — wrong component, wrong reason, wrong datetime, deleted submission —
were all silent.

**Fix**: read `readOfficialSubmission(target, files)`, the same artefact an
external evaluator consumes.

**Guard**: `test/official-submission.test.ts` corrupts each of the four and
asserts the regression fails, plus a case-for-case agreement check against
`scoreOfficial`. Injecting the old line back fails 5 tests.

## 2 — An empty denominator scored as a perfect match

```ts
function rateOf(predicted, expected) {
  if (expected.length === 0) return 1;   // before
  return intersectCount(predicted, expected) / expected.length;
}
```

`1` for an empty `expected` makes "the key asked nothing" and "the prediction
answered everything" the same number. An RCA100 key declaring no chain and no
checkpoint collected the full 0.3 process weight, identically to a key that
declared both and had them matched.

Measured: a case with an empty chain and empty checkpoint list produced
`{"process":1,"chainNodeMatch":1,"checkpointHit":1}` and a headline of 100.

**Fix**: return `undefined`, and let a new `meanOfPresent` average only the terms
that have a denominator. When no term has one the answer is 0, not 1.

**Guard**: `test/official-empty-denominator.test.ts`. Injecting `return 1` back
fails 3 tests.

## 3 — The checksum rate divided by the anchor set

```ts
const total = matched + mismatched.length + missing.length;   // before
```

With `extra` — files the anchors never mention — left out, the numerator and the
denominator were both about anchors, so an unanchored file was neither verified
nor held against the rate. One anchor out of twenty-two produced `score: 100`
beside `passed: false`, which is the worst pair to hand an operator: the number
says the export is perfect, the flag says it is not, and the number is the half
people read.

The existing test asserted `passed` and `extra`, not `score`, which is why it
survived beside its own comment saying the problem must be visible.

**Fix**: add `extra.length` to the denominator. A comparison set is a claim about
the whole export.

**Guard**: `test/score-anchor-denominator.test.ts`, including a monotonicity case
(more unanchored files must lower the score). Injecting the old line fails 2
tests.

## 4 — `openrca-2.0` silently inherited strict accuracy

`aggregateFor` was a chain of `if (target === …)` blocks with nine targets and
six branches. `openrca-2.0` was never named, so it fell through to the generic
strict-accuracy block and reported the share of cases where *every* facet was
reproduced exactly — a different function from the one its own spec advertises
(`matched facets / scored facets`).

The two formulas agree on a perfect export and on an empty one, which is why the
regression never noticed. They part company in between: measured `accuracy: 0.75`
beside `final: 0` for a prediction that reproduced three of the four declared
facets.

**Fix**: name the branch, and end the chain in a `never` guard so a tenth target
stops the build instead of inheriting a formula.

**Guard**: `test/official-aggregate-coverage.test.ts`. Injecting the missing
branch back fails 1 test.

## 5 — An empty AIOps2025 corpus was fully explained

```ts
const explainability = et === 0 ? 1 : em / et;   // before
```

`et` is the total number of evidence points the corpus declares. Answering `1`
when there are none handed an export that declared no evidence at all a free
tenth of the score. Measured: an empty AIOps2025 export scored `final: 10` while
the other eight targets scored 0. It was the only target with a non-zero score on
a nonexistent export.

The other three terms in the same formula already answered 0 with nothing to
average (`la`, `ta`, `eff`), so explainability was the outlier.

**Fix**: `et === 0 ? 0 : em / et`.

**Guard**: `test/official-no-denominator.test.ts` and a corrected assertion in
`test/official.test.ts`. Injecting `? 1` back fails 2 tests.

## 6 — A vacuous structure report earned half the score

Found while building the guard for finding 2. `scoreExport` averages the
structure rate and the checksum rate, and the structure rate was credited
unconditionally. Four of the thirteen OpenRCA checks pass on an empty export
because there is nothing for them to inspect:

- `answer-key-isolated` — "query.csv carries no answer key" holds when there is
  no query.csv;
- `log-header` and `trace-header` — both explicitly accept an absent telemetry
  directory (Telecom ships no logs, so this is deliberate);
- `row-alignment` — zero rows equals zero rows.

That is a structure rate of 0.31, and an empty export reported `score: 15` while
`passed` was correctly `false`.

**Fix**: credit the structure rate only when the structure report passes. The
report's own `passed` flag already answers this correctly; the rate is only
meaningful once the verdict is.

**Guard**: a case in `test/score-anchor-denominator.test.ts` asserting an empty
export scores 0. Injecting the unconditional rate back fails it.

## Method

Each finding was reproduced before being fixed, by running the scoring path
against a fixture and reading the number. Each fix is accompanied by a test that
fails without it: the injection matrix in `test/` reintroduces each defect and
records whether the suite catches it, and two negative controls (a reordered
breakdown key and a comment edit) must stay green so the matrix is not red on
everything.

The parser that reads the suite's own counts had two defects of its own, both
fixed: it read `Tests <n> passed` off a fixed shape, which reports 0 on every
failing run because vitest prints `Tests 1 failed | 54 passed`, and it matched
`Test Files 56 passed` first, which reports the file count as the test count.
